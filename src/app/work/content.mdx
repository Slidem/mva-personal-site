# Senior Softare Engineer @ Ourcart (Contractor) | August 2021 - December 2022

The startup had a product that was collecting store receipts data for market analysis purposes. Rapid scale-up and growing technical debt quickly became a real challenge

## ü•á Key Contributions and Achievements:

### Automated regression tests:
- **Reduced regressions by 100%** for key microservice responsible for entity recognition for receipt data, by designing and implementing a regression test pipeline with auto generated test cases. Leveraged AWS services such as CodePipeline, CodeBuild, S3.
### Regex tool matcher for receipt data: 
- **Increased onboarding speed for new clients by 50%** by developing a tool for automation of regex matching. Took advantage of AWS‚Äôs ECS, StepFunctions and API Gateway services to orchestrate several microservices to achieve the desired outcome 
### Cost saving and infrastructure optimization:
- **Cut costs by 50%** by migrating existing lambda functions to a more suitable architecture, using AWS Glue to create ETL jobs as a replacement.

# Senior Backend Engineer @ Blue Wire Software (Contractor) | January 2021 - August 2021

Client had an RV market place, that was growing quickly and had to satisfy new scaling needs. The infrastructure was moved to GCP, but there was a huge technical debt to be covered from the migration.

## ü•á Key Contributions and Achievements:

### Cloud migration and cost optimization:
- **Saved costs of ~10K USD / month** by containerising and deploying existing services that were still running on Heroku to GCP.
- **Moved over 80% of existing NGINX configurations** from Digital Ocean to GCP, by containerising existing NGINX configurations, and creating fast pipelines to deploy new changes to GCP.
### Instrumentation and automation: 
- **Improved APM of over 70% of existing services**, by instrumenting existing GoLang / Java / NodeJS services with appropriate metrics and traces for DataDog. 
- **Reversed engineered Notion's APIs**, as there was no public API ready, to create a custom github action written in GoLang that would import a repository's markdowns into Notion.
- **Designed custom preview pipelines**, that would deploy the code of a PR, in order for the changes to be viewed live before a PR was approved and merged.

# Software Engineer @ Mambu | November 2019 - January 2021

At Mambu, I was integral to the development and maintenance of the company's SaaS banking solutions, primarily on deployed AWS and later extended to be cross-compatible with Google Cloud. 
My main focus was on the IAM team, where I worked on a large monolithic Java application using GWT for the front-end and Java 1.8 with Google Guice and JDO frameworks for the back-end. 
This application, deployed on AWS Beanstalk and MySQL, was complemented by a suite of microservices on Kubernetes. 
Key aspects of my role included enhancing user authentication and authorization, API management, and security features, as well as developing disaster recovery mechanisms and ensuring platform compatibility across cloud environments.

## ü•á Key Contributions and Achievements:

### IAM Enhancements and Security Improvements:
- **Developed and optimized IAM features**, focusing on user experience in managing authentication, authorization, and API key management.
- Implemented a **key rotation mechanism** to bolster security, reducing vulnerabilities related to static API keys.

### Streaming API and Disaster Recovery Mechanisms:
- **Developed and maintained a custom streaming API solution** using Nakadi, facilitating real-time data handling.
- **Maintained a robust disaster recovery process**, storing event streams in S3 for quick recovery, enhancing the platform's resilience.

### Google Cloud Compatibility and Cross-Cloud Deployment:
- Successfully **containerized the monolithic application for deployment in Google Cloud's Kubernetes**, reducing the banking engine's start-up time by 50%.
- **Ensured cross-compatibility between AWS and Google Cloud services**, developing custom solutions where direct compatibility was absent.
- Developed **custom CI/CD pipelines in GitLab** for efficient cross-deployment management.

# Senior Software Engineer @ Oodrive | January 2017 - November 2019

At Oodrive, my primary focus was on the development and enhancement of a robust file sharing platform, a critical component of the company's SaaS offerings. This platform, deployable on-premise or on cloud infrastructure, was built on a microservices architecture using Java 1.8 and Spring Framework, later migrating to Spring Boot 2. 
Key technologies included Kafka for event streaming, Zookeeper for service discovery, RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication, and PostgreSQL for persistence. I also our in-house single sign-on solution, integrating various authentication methods and using Redis for distributed session management.
